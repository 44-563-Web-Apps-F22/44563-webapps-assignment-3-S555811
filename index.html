    <h1>Yeluri Vengalarao</h1>

    <h6>Salar Jung Museum</h6>
    <p>The Veiled <b>Rebecca</b>, the statue of <b>Mephistopheles</b> and the century-old bracket clock that stil
         keeps time are the three “must-see” exhibits that everyone makes a beeline for when they visit the Salar Jung museum. 
        However, this is nowhere near a good representation of what is on offer, neither
         are these the most precious of the items in the collections.</p>
