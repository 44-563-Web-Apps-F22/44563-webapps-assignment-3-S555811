    <P>Yaks are heavily built animals with bulky frames, sturdy legs, rounded, cloven hooves, and extremely dense, long fur that hangs down 
        lower than the belly. While wild yaks are generally dark, blackish to brown in colouration, domestic yaks can be quite
         variable in colour, often having patcXXZZX               hes of rusty brown and cream. They have small ears and wide foreheads, with smooth horns that are generally dark in colour.
          In males (bulls), the horns sweep out from the sides of the head, and then curve forward. They typically range from 48 to 99 cm (19 to 39 in) in length. 
          The horns of females (cows) are smaller, only 27 to 64 cm (11 to 25 in) in length, and have a more upright shape. Both sexes have a short neck with a pronounced hump over the shoulders, 
          although this is larger and more visible in males.[5] Males weigh 350 to 585 kg (772 to 1,290 lb), females weigh 225 to 255 kg (496 to 562 lb). Wild yaks can be substantially heavier,
           bulls reaching weights of up to 1,000 kilograms (2,200 lb).[9] Depending on the breed, domestic yak males are 111–138 centimetres (44–54 in) high at the withers, while females are 105–117 
           centimetres (41–46 in) high at the withers.[</P>
